Vinyl classics

Can only put together audio, so very recognisable.
Need to learn fx for it to work well.  Othrewise, will just
sound straight out of pack.  This is reverse, compression, etc.

Use sparingly, but great stuff, so use!

Unnatural selection

Mostly sucks, loops OK.  Fodder for massive SuperCollider fuckery.

Sound Objects Lite

Can plug objects into a drum rack - cool sounds.  No premade racks.

Loopmasters mixtapes

UNREAL! Listen to construction kits for inspiration, and there's a drum for
all of them.

Clips are good but hit or miss - some are audio.  There are lots of them so
if there's a coup de cœur, use it.

Konkrete breaks

FANTASTICH!! All clips midi'd, so can modify them. Small group of great
drums. Demo songs ok... I <3 2+2=4.alc

KJ Sawka

Some nice stuff!  Several kits, all good.  No loops but that's ok...

Guitar and Bass

Skip...

Grand Piano

Skip...

Drum Machines

GREAT RETRO!! Like Konkrete breaks, all clips midi'd, so can modify them.
Effected drum kits and then just normal list of kids good.

Digicussion 1, Digicussion 2

GREAT idea.  Principle is that there are families of kid.  Generally, one
beat in one works in others - mappings kept consistant across kits.  Not a
lot of clips, but can do lots of tweaking...

Designer Drums

COOL! Clips hold racks which can be subbed out...  Clip racks are coherent.

Cyclic waves

Ok...has some loops that could be used if you like them.

Core Library

Ok meat and potato drums.  Clips uninspiring and unfortunately audio...

Breakbeats

AWWWWWW $H!T! Great. Organized fantastically well.  The guy makes a piece
for each drum in Construction Kits.  These are decomposed into clips.  And
all the stuff that makes them is in drums.  WOOOWWW!!!!

Bombastic

DA BOMB. Ok clips but drums are where it's at.  Same subbing concept as
designer drums - winner.
